# Automation Local Food Bank
Building AI course project

## Summary
First phase: Creation of machine learning models based on historical data from a Food Bank.

Second phase: Automation of a local Food Bank, using an App integrated with a ChatBot with NLP, to manage the food demand of needy families.

## Background
A food bank is a volunteer-based organization whose objective is to recover food, especially non-perishable food, from companies, supermarkets and individuals, through collaborating associations, for subsequent free distribution to people at risk of social exclusion. 
The management of a food bank is complex, so sometimes resources are wasted (food that expires, that remains in stock, that is not distributed efficiently, etc.) and it is complicated to organize the volunteers, the inventory in the warehouses and the collection and distribution of food.
I believe that, in order to tackle this project, it would be necessary to do it in two stages: 
First stage: With the historical data that we currently have in spreadsheets, we can make a prediction of the food needed for distribution in each campaign, through automatic training, to improve the use of resources, avoiding the accumulation of surplus in warehouse, the expiration of food or the increase of spoiled or damaged food for various reasons, making a more efficient food distribution.
Second stage: Once the results of the first stage have been seen, in order to improve the system, an integrated food management system could be implemented in which a specialized App integrated with a chatbot would play an important role, using predictive data from automatic training based on historical data on inventory, storage, requests, food distribution and volunteer management; as well as communication with the parties involved with valuable information (recipients, donors, neighborhood associations, volunteers, etc.).
My personal motivation comes from the voluntary participation in the work of a food bank. This issue is important because it is about optimizing resources for families living in poverty or at risk of social exclusion.
In the project I am presenting for the Building AI course, I will develop only the first stage.
